Simple Read Only Filesystem (SROFS)
-----------------------------------

SROFS is a simple design of a readonly filesystem for embedded systems such as
Atmel ATmega based microcontroller boards (Arduino in mind).

Structures
----------

A SROFS filesystem consists of
 - a superblock
 - a file index
 - one or more files

There are no directories although the filesystem API may provide virtual access
to directory structures.

Superblock (first device block):
[0-4]   MAGIC           "SROFS" filesystem identifier
[5  ]   VERSION         SROFS version number, currently 0
[6  ]   BLOCKSIZE       Size of a logical filesystem block, 2^BLOCKSIZE
                        default 9 = 2^9 = 512 byte blocks
[7  ]	FINDEX_BLOCK    Logical blocknumber of first file index block

File Index:
[File Entry]*           One or more file entry structures

File Entry:
[0-118]    FILE_PATH        NUL terminated string containing the complete file 
                            path (ASCII), e.g. "wwwroot/foo/bar.txt"
[119-122]  NUM_BLOCKS	    Number of used logical blocks 
[123-126]  FIRST_BLOCK      Logical block index of first data block
[127-128]  LAST_BLOCK_SIZE  Number of octets used in last data block
